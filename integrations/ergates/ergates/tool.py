"""Hermes plugin wiring: the Ergates tools, the attention hooks and the tool gate.

Registered by ``register(ctx)`` in the top-level ``__init__.py`` (the Hermes
plugin entry point). Kept separate from ``ctx`` so every function here stays
plain and unit-testable: each takes its dependencies (a service, a delivery
worker, config values) as explicit arguments rather than reaching into a
global ``ctx``.

Every handler writes to the one control store of the Hermes install,
``<hermes root>/ergates/control.sqlite3``, whichever profile it runs in. The
profile itself is read from Hermes at every call
(:func:`~ergates.hermes_adapter.current_profile`), never once at
registration: a multiplexed gateway serves several profiles from one
process (roadmap bug 8).

    Always returns a JSON string, per the Hermes tool contract: a validation
    failure, a proposal-id collision or a store failure comes back as
    ``{"error": "..."}`` rather than raising. A store failure names the
    exception class only. Never creates a profile.

    ``source_session_id`` is backend-owned: Hermes dispatches tool handlers
    as ``handler(args, task_id=..., session_id=...)`` (``tools/registry.py``'s
    ``dispatch`` via ``_execute_tool``'s ``dispatch_kwargs`` in the pinned
    checkout), never as a model-supplied argument. ``validate_proposal``
    never reads a ``source_session_id`` key out of ``args`` at all, and the
    line below always sets it from these handler kwargs -- so a caller that
    sneaks a ``source_session_id`` into ``args`` has it silently overwritten,
    never honored. ``session_id`` is preferred; ``task_id`` is the fallback
    for contexts (e.g. cron) that may carry a task id but no session id.

    The stored receipt is **not** the proposal. 11 section 4.1 defines it
    as "proposal hash, reserved profile name, completed steps, session id
    and briefing delivery state" -- so :meth:`ProposalService.record` keeps
    the sha256 of the proposal exactly as returned to the caller, which is
    what the accept operation verifies the approved payload against, and
    never the ``briefing`` (up to 4,000 characters of user content) or the
