"""The one module of the ergates package that imports Hermes.

Every other module reaches Hermes through the functions here, so a Hermes
upgrade has one file to check in this package (plus ``dashboard/api.py``).
``tests/test_hermes_boundary.py`` fails the build when any other module
imports Hermes. ``contract/test_hermes_adapter.py`` pins each Hermes fact used
here in the pinned source, and ``contract/live/`` runs these functions
against the pinned Hermes itself.

Imports happen inside each function, so importing this module never needs
Hermes: the test suite and ``python -m ergates.flush`` run without it.

Every call about one profile runs the way Hermes's own ``cron.manage`` RPC
runs for a ``profile`` parameter (``tui_gateway/methods_tools.py`` at the
pin): ``get_profile_dir(profile)`` becomes the context-local Hermes home
(``set_hermes_home_override``) for the call and is reset afterwards. Config,
cron and plugin discovery all resolve ``get_hermes_home()`` at call time, so
they act on that profile, and no other thread sees the override.
