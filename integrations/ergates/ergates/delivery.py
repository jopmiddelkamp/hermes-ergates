"""Push delivery for attention events: the ntfy request, the deep link, and the leased outbox worker.

:class:`DeliveryWorker` sends the ``attention_outbox`` rows that
:class:`~ergates.attention.AttentionService` committed with each event. A
worker first claims a row -- a :data:`LEASE_SECONDS` lease taken inside a
store transaction -- and no other worker (a hook's background thread,
``python -m ergates.flush``, a second flush) claims it while the lease
holds. Push is at least once, which docs/11 section 4.2 allows: a worker
that dies mid-send leaves a lease that runs out, and the next worker sends
the row again; and :meth:`DeliveryWorker.run_due` leases a whole batch at
once, so when sending the batch takes longer than :data:`LEASE_SECONDS`, a
second worker can claim and send its later rows too.

Bookkeeping stays on the outbox row: attempts, backoff (30 s, 120 s, 600 s,
then 600 s) and give-up after five attempts. A completion retry that would
land inside the profile's quiet hours waits until they end, read in the
Hermes timezone like the first attempt; an approval retry ignores quiet
hours. The event's own ``state`` is
never written here, so a failed delivery can never overwrite a resolution
(roadmap bug 5). An approval that is no longer pending, or past its
``expires_at``, is cancelled instead of sent: its push would point the
operator at a request that can no longer be answered.

The stock Hermes ntfy adapter never sets a ``Click`` header;
:func:`build_ntfy_publish` builds the full request -- ``Title``, ``Click``,
``Priority``, ``X-Tags`` and a fixed body -- without sending it. The body is
always ``You have a new request``: a push carries identifiers and a generic
title, never a command, a prompt or an approval decision (docs/04 sections
6-7). The event id goes out as ntfy's ``X-Sequence-ID``: a push sent again
after a lost answer is the same event, and an ntfy client that supports
sequence ids (the Android app from 1.22.2 with server 2.16.0 or later; not
the iOS app as of 1.7.0) replaces the first notification instead of showing
a second one. The app opens the same chat from either notification.
