# gflow's version script (gflow README, "Version script"). gflow runs it with
# the clean X.Y.Z of a new release or hotfix, never an -rc.N, and commits what
# it changed as "chore: set version X.Y.Z". It writes that one version into
# every file of the repository that carries it (apps/mobile/RELEASING.md) and
# changes nothing else. A file whose version line is not where this script
# expects it stops the run before any file is written.
#
# It writes only on a release or hotfix branch (and on gflow's release-chore
# branch for a release). gflow also runs it to move develop to the next minor,
# on develop itself or on a chore/set-version-* branch; there it changes
# nothing, so the version reaches develop only through gflow's release and
# hotfix merges, and those merges never conflict on the version lines.
