/**
 * useTranscriptWindow: the REST transcript window for one chat, and the fetch
 * scheduling spec 5.8 asks for.
 *
 * React adapter (ADR-029 rule 2): every rule it applies lives in `window.ts` and
 * `exchange.ts`, which are pure and tested in Node — this file only holds the
 * Query, the refs and the effects. The window is memory-only, in the TanStack
 * cache, never persisted (ADR-028), and nothing here calls `prompt.submit`
 * (ADR-027).
 *
 * Scheduling, all of it event-driven (no timer anywhere, ruling 14):
 *  - the first page is the Query's own `queryFn`;
 *  - every `tailWanted` bump (a local turn completing, a `status.update
 *    {kind:"process"}`, a `message_agent` completion) runs one tail, continuing
 *    backward until it reaches the rows already loaded;
 *  - evidence that must be older (a receipt without its send, a tool row without
 *    its assistant row) pages backward under the four-page budget;
 *  - returning to the foreground re-runs the tail once;
 *  - a failed fetch writes its message into the window and waits for the next
 *    trigger — it never retries on its own.
