/**
 * Dragging an agent between the pinned area and the rows list in Home Edit
 * mode (docs/10 "Home edit mode"; the rules are the agents feature's
 * `crossSlot`, `crossMove` and `crossDrop`): a row dragged by its ≡ and
 * dropped over the pinned area is pinned at that spot, and a pin dragged by
 * its move handle and dropped over the rows list is unpinned and placed
 * there. The move goes to Home's `onMove`, the organizer, which queues the
 * pinned flag (and the section, when it changed) for Hermes.
 *
 * react-native-sortables 1.10 cannot hand an item from one drag list to
 * another, so each area keeps its own drag and this hook follows the finger:
 * both lists' `onDragStart` name the drag to follow (`begin`), their
 * `onDragMove` record its finger on the UI thread, and one reaction over the
 * finger and the scroll offset measures both areas and the part of the
 * scroll view the owner sees, and keeps `slot`, the slot under the finger in
 * the other area, current. It listens to the scroll offset too because
 * `onDragMove` is silent while the list auto-scrolls under a still finger.
 * `slot` drives the insertion markers (`CrossMarkers.tsx`) and, while a row
 * is over the pinned area, the rows list's sort strategy. At the drop, each
 * area's `onDragEnd` asks `end` first: over the other area, the move goes to
 * Home and the area skips its own drop.
 *
 * A full-width row over the pinned area would hide the avatars and the
 * marker, so while it is there the row fades: the rows list's
 * `activeItemOpacity` (`rowOpacity`) takes the lifted row to
 * `HOVER_OPACITY`, its `activeItemShadowOpacity` (`rowShadow`) drops the
 * library's shadow, and the row's own background layer clears
 * (`hovering`, read by `HomeRow`). Only the lifted row changes.
