/**
 * The bottom safe-area padding rule (docs/10 section 4): content scrolls to
 * the bottom edge of the phone, so a scroll view never insets its own frame
 * there — its content container carries the device's bottom inset as
 * padding instead, on top of whatever bottom padding the screen already
 * wanted. A fixed bottom bar (no scrolling) uses the same rule with its own
 * padding as `base`, which is 0 when it had none before.
 *
 * While the keyboard is open, `KeyboardAvoidingView`'s `padding` behavior
 * already pushes the view up by the full keyboard height, measured down to
 * the physical bottom of the screen — the inset is already covered by the
 * keyboard. Adding it again here would leave an empty gap between the last
 * field and the keyboard, so it is dropped until the keyboard closes.
