# Ergates mobile

React Native (Expo SDK 57) client for a team of Hermes Agent assistants. Design and contracts: `../../docs/`.

## Run on the iOS simulator

1. Start a local Hermes backend in token mode (loopback bind, no password gate):

   ```bash
   export HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
   echo "$HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN"   # paste this into the app's Connect screen
   hermes serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9119 --skip-build
   ```

2. Build and launch the development client (first build takes several minutes):

   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   npm install
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

   Later runs only need Metro: `npx expo start`, then open the Ergates app on the simulator.

3. In the app: Connect with `http://127.0.0.1:9119` and the token. Home shows the roster; tap the concierge to chat.

For a gateway on the Tailscale VPS (password mode) enter its URL; the app reads `/api/status`, sees `auth_required: true`, and asks for provider, username and password.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Vitest in Node: reducer, outbox, organization, theme, adapters, and the session controller driven by the fake gateway |
| `npm run test:coverage` | The same tests with the coverage gate (thresholds in `vitest.config.mts`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript 6 strict) |
| `npm run depcruise` | The ADR-029 dependency rules in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with `eslint-config-expo` (hooks rules included); fails on any warning |
| `../../scripts/ci-local.sh mobile` | The CI `mobile` job: typecheck, lint, coverage gate, dependency rules |
| `ERGATES_LIVE=1 ERGATES_TOKEN=… npx vitest run test/live` | Smoke check against a real backend (docs/11 section 3) |
| `ERGATES_LIVE=1 ERGATES_RECORD=1 ERGATES_TOKEN=… ERGATES_OUT=… npx vitest run test/live/agent-traffic-record.live.test.ts` | Re-record the bot-to-bot traffic fixtures (sanitize by hand before copying into `test/fixtures/agent-traffic/`) |
| `npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean` | Regenerate the native project after changing plugins in `app.json` |
| `npm run release:check` / `npm run release` | Store release to TestFlight and Google Play internal testing via EAS; secrets in the git-ignored `.release/`. Setup: [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) |

## Layout

```text
app/            expo-router screens (layout and wiring only)
src/gateway/    GatewayPort contract (port.ts: ConnectedGateway, BOT_CHAT_TITLE), wire types, error mapping,
                transcript normalizer, secret-store contract, real adapter (HTTP, auth, socket), registry
src/features/   one folder per feature, each with a public index.ts: chat (reducer, session controller,
                canonical chat, send queue), agents (roster, editor, agent proposals and their
                provisioning), routines, files, voice, settings, attention (push deep link,
                notification settings); `app/+native-intent.tsx` sends a push link to `app/open.tsx`
src/state/      Zustand device store: connections, pins, sections, unread, drafts, outbox, prefs
src/theme/      vendored Hermes palettes resolved for React Native; skin sync
src/ui/         shared components
test/fixtures/  sanitized recorded backend shapes
test/fake-gateway/  FakeGateway (same GatewayPort), in-memory outbox, transcript window helper
test/scenarios/     behavior tests: the real session controller against the FakeGateway
vendor/hermes/  pinned upstream client and theme sources (MIT), see PIN.md
```

Rules (ADR-029), enforced by `npm run depcruise`:

- Screens, UI and other features import a feature only through its `src/features/<name>/index.ts`.
- The gateway and the device store never import screens or features; only `src/gateway` imports the real adapter.
- The port, the session reducer, the session controller and `vendor/hermes` import no React, React Native or Expo module.
- The device store holds no Hermes data: it imports neither TanStack Query nor the gateway (except the secret-store contract).
- `use-session.ts` is a thin React binding of `createSessionController` (`session-controller.ts`); the scenario tests drive that same controller.
- Each native module (cookies, secure storage, AsyncStorage, file pickers, speech) is imported by its one adapter.
- No import cycles, and every import resolves to a file.

Development-only hooks (compiled out of release bundles): `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_GATEWAY_URL`/`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (auto-connect), `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_INITIAL_ROUTE` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_ROUTE_URL` (navigate on launch), and the chat route params `?devSend=<prompt>`, `?devFocus=1`, `?devInject=refused|waiting|sending|mixed` (synthetic `message_agent` frames through the normal reducer path). `npm run typecheck` passes on a fresh checkout without `.expo/types` (CI runs it that way); `expo start` regenerates `.expo/types/router.d.ts`.
