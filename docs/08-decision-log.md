# 08 - Architecture Decision Log

Updated 2026-09-12 after Jop requested corrections and supplied mobile references; ADR-029 (app code shape) added 2026-09-13. These are current design decisions, not claims of implementation or approval of purchases/deployment. Unverified extension mechanisms are gates in 11. Earlier own-platform records ADR-001–016 remain in the [archived decision log](archive/2026-09-12-own-platform-design/08-decision-log.md); do not build from them.

## ADR-017 Hermes owns the backend domain

Hermes supplies the agent loop, sessions, memory, profiles, tools, cron and rooms. Build the mobile app and deployment against its supported client surfaces. Keep no independent agent runtime, domain database, memory index or general API facade. Amended by ADR-025: narrowly scoped integration state and extension endpoints are necessary for product behavior Hermes does not already supply.

## ADR-018 React Native over the Hermes client protocol

Use Expo development builds and the pinned JSON-RPC client plus REST. Native HTTP/cookies, sockets, image transfer and persistence are adapters with P0 checks. The OpenAI-compatible API server is a separate optional automation path; its run-idempotency guarantees do not apply to mobile `prompt.submit`. The mobile app has no web/desktop-client deliverable.

## ADR-019 One assistant is one Hermes profile

Use `ui_meta`, assets, `SOUL.md`, canonical `BOT_CHAT_TITLE` sessions and Bot Mode messaging conventions. Enable kanban work tracking in P1, its UI in P2. Agent creation by chat needs the typed proposal and safe provisioning path in 11. Same-gateway room limits are not global Bot-message hop/spend limits; cross-gateway relay and human sharing need separate proof.

## ADR-020 Model access is a per-profile provider setting

Select from the pinned backend's configured provider/model options. API-key access is the initial engineering default until the operator supplies a chosen account. Keep provider entitlement/billing/terms distinct from source-level technical support. Do not claim changing auth paths is always one line. Do not hardcode unverified model ids in role defaults; use available options and validate the selected model.

## ADR-021 Effective grants and conditional approvals

Hermes owns session tool grants; MCP config saves may be deferred. A revocation must stop/drain affected work, narrow configuration, rebuild execution contexts and verify the result before the UI says Off. Shell `manual` approval is conditional and is not a universal MCP action gate. Send/pay/delete remain excluded until explicit tool-specific approval semantics are implemented. Plain-language custom policy rules are deferred. Details in 04.

## ADR-022 Sandboxes are air-gapped by default

Use one Docker shell workspace per profile, narrow verified mounts, resource limits and no shared container key. Both trusted tool-running controllers need Docker access; shell sandboxes get neither the daemon socket nor connector/provider grants. Host-side MCP/plugin execution is a separate boundary. Controllers use enforced outbound allowlisting; networked shells require a later explicit design. Deployment is accepted only after actual mount/network tests, not from a sketch.

## ADR-023 Push needs a server attention bridge

P1 uses private ntfy; P2 adds Expo transport. Both rely on the integration event source and durable delivery records. Stock ntfy publication does not subscribe to mobile-chat approval events or supply chat deep links. Implement those, configure iOS upstream wake-up, and prove locked-phone delivery in P0/P1. Approval timeout is a pending-window setting, not a notification mechanism.

## ADR-024 Private auth first

Use the basic provider over Tailscale through JSON password login, a tested cookie adapter and short-lived WebSocket tickets. Later public access uses TLS plus OAuth/OIDC and a verified native redirect flow; desktop loopback support is not mobile compatibility. Keep no public service listener in P0–P2.

## ADR-025 Small Ergates integration package

The previous app/config-only assumption did not cover typed creation actions, failure-safe provisioning, reminder deduplication or server-to-phone attention. Define these as new extension work with small atomic file journals and authenticated operator operations in 11. Prefer supported external plugin hooks; prove event-source and authenticated-route registration in P0. If absent, scope the upstream extension explicitly. Never give agents the authenticated accept operation or control-plane credentials. This amends ADR-017, 019 and 023 without creating a second agent runtime. Amended by ADR-030: one transactional SQLite control store replaces the file journals.

## ADR-026 Mobile layout from references, colors from Hermes

Jop explicitly requested the clean iPhone style shown in nine screenshots. Adopt flat Home rows, optional pinned avatars, compact chat controls, rounded bubbles/composer and grouped settings sheets. Use Hermes `DesktopThemeColors`, Nous light/dark palettes and `HermesSkin` conversion/resolution. Appearance defaults to System. Mobile includes desktop-equivalent Edit Bot with Save/Cancel, partial-save recovery, and compact context menus/More as explicitly requested. Friendly name and role badge have separate metadata mappings. Detailed tokens, native geometry, states and visual acceptance live in 10; screenshot colors and vendor branding are not product tokens.

2026-09-13 clarification (tenth mobile reference): Home sections such as Prive use small grey text and a collapse/expand chevron. Pin state is independent of membership: Linh and Kevin remain Prive members while pinned above it, and unpinning returns them to Prive. Persist both properties and section collapse state; collapsing a section does not hide pinned members. FR-13D and 10 define the Phase 1 acceptance cases.

## ADR-027 Honest reminder and offline-delivery semantics

The pinned cron ticker defaults to 60 seconds. P1 ordinary reminders target measured job start within 90 seconds on a healthy idle server, with phone delivery measured separately. Sub-minute/five-second precision is deferred. Client request ids do not establish durable exactly-once submission: uncertain sends require reconciliation and deliberate retry. Custom proposal/job-create retries use integration receipts, not text matching.

## ADR-028 Explicit local data and capacity

Authoritative history remains on the VPS; encrypted off-host backups, device drafts and optional caches are documented in 05. Default history caching is memory-only; connection removal clears account data and warns about unsent work. The schedule is derived from effort and actual engineering availability; 07 replaces the earlier part-time label paired with effectively full-time dates.

## ADR-029 App code shape: feature modules behind one gateway port

Decided 2026-09-13 after Jop chose this option over full Clean Architecture and a flat screens/hooks/services layout. The app is organized as feature modules with a ports-and-adapters boundary at the Hermes edge and a strict split between server-owned and device-owned state. Details, the port contract and the state table are in [03 section 3.1](03-technical-design.md#31-code-architecture-rules-adr-029).

Rules:

1. Dependencies point inward. `app/` screens import features; features import the gateway port, the Query cache and the device store. The port contract, the pure session reducer and `vendor/hermes` import no React Native or Expo module.
2. One home per data item. Hermes-owned data (profiles, sessions, history, routines, config, pending requests) lives only in the TanStack Query cache. Device-owned data from 05 (connections, pins, sections, collapsed state, watermarks, drafts) lives only in the Zustand store. Nothing is copied between the two.
3. Live socket events pass through one pure reducer per session. It produces the rendered message list, the replay watermark and the delivery states. The fake gateway drives the same reducer as the real adapter.
4. Every native capability (HTTP/cookies, WebSocket tickets, secure storage, file transfer, speech, notification registration) is a small interface with one real adapter and one fake. P0 gates run the real adapter; client behavior tests run the fake.

Rejected: full Clean Architecture (domain, use-case and infrastructure layers with injection), because Hermes owns the domain and the app has little domain logic to isolate. Rejected: flat screens/hooks/services, because streaming, replay and uncertain-send handling do not survive being spread across screens. Zustand is the working choice for the device store because it is the smallest option; it is not itself a P0 gate. Package versions remain locked in P0 per 03.

## ADR-030 One transactional control store for the integration

Decided 2026-09-25 with the Fable upgrade roadmap (decision D2). The integration keeps every record -- reminder and proposal receipts, attention events, their push outbox and attention preferences -- in one SQLite file, `<hermes root>/ergates/control.sqlite3`, shared by every profile and process of the install. Writes use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; every receipt change is a versioned compare-and-set; an attention event and its outbox row commit in one transaction; the schema is versioned with `PRAGMA user_version`. The store keeps identifiers and sha256 hashes, never prompt, command, briefing or description text. Hermes databases are never written.

Rejected: the per-kind JSON file journals of ADR-025, because a lock per directory could not make a check and a write atomic: two concurrent reminder retries could create two cron jobs, the retention sweep could delete a receipt that had just been claimed again, and a crash during the first push lost it. The old journals are not migrated; they were never installed on a live gateway. This amends ADR-025.

## ADR-031 Integration operations are routes of the Hermes dashboard

Decided 2026-09-25 with the Fable upgrade roadmap (decision D3). The operations the app calls -- reminder create, proposal accept, reject and provisioning steps, plugin enable, attention preferences, health -- are routes of the plugin's dashboard API router, which `hermes serve` mounts under `/api/plugins/ergates` from `integrations/ergates/dashboard/manifest.json`. Hermes's own middleware authenticates every request before a route runs: the dashboard session token on loopback, the cookie gate when dashboard auth is on. A contract test runs the pinned Hermes web server and shows a request without the token is refused on every route. This settles the "registration/auth mechanism" gate of 11 section 4.1 without a Hermes patch.

Rejected: a separate Ergates HTTP service, because it would need its own listener, auth and TLS next to `hermes serve`, and a second credential on the phone.

## ADR-032 App-orchestrated provisioning with server receipts

Decided 2026-09-25 with the Fable upgrade roadmap (decision D4). After the operator accepts a proposal, the app performs the provisioning steps through the public Hermes RPCs it already uses -- `profiles.create` with `mirror_credentials: false`, `profiles.configure` from the server's template, `session.create` for the Bot Chat, `prompt.submit` for the briefing -- and reports each step to the integration, which records it on the proposal receipt in order. The integration performs only the step the app cannot: it links the plugin into the new profile and enables it there. It marks the proposal `complete` only after Hermes itself reports that the profile exists and would load the plugin in it. Until then the plugin's `pre_tool_call` gate blocks every tool of that profile, so no turn runs under an unreviewed grant.

This deviates from 11 section 4.1, which had the integration drive the profile operations itself. The integration would then call Hermes's profile and session internals from inside a plugin, which no public plugin surface offers; the app already has an authenticated, public path to every one of those operations. Rejected for the same reason: a server-side orchestrator that replays the app's RPCs. The receipt keeps resume-by-receipt: a killed app reopens at the next unreported step.

## ADR-033 The whole device blob is encrypted at rest

Decided 2026-09-25. The app keeps its device-owned data -- connections, roster organization, preferences, drafts, the outbox and unfinished agent setups -- as one JSON blob in AsyncStorage, and now seals that blob with AES-256-GCM from expo-crypto before it is written. The key is created on the first write and stored in SecureStore with `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`, and kept in memory once read, so a write while the phone is locked still seals. The sealing sits behind a small cipher interface (`src/state/sealed-storage.ts`); Node tests pass an AES-GCM cipher from `node:crypto`, and only `src/state/persistence.ts` imports expo-crypto. A plaintext blob from an earlier version is read once and rewritten sealed; a blob whose key is gone (a backup restored onto another phone) reads as empty; a blob that cannot be opened now is kept, not overwritten. Writes land in call order.

Rejected: encrypting only drafts and the outbox, because connections and agent setups (a proposal's briefing) are just as private and one sealed blob is simpler than two stores. Rejected: a key restored with device backups, because a backup would then carry both the ciphertext and its key.

## ADR-034 The tool gate enforces the profile's toolset grant

Decided 2026-09-25. The plugin's `pre_tool_call` gate refuses a tool whose toolset the profile's configuration no longer grants: the toolset pin `profiles.configure` writes (`tools.enabled_toolsets`, which the app sets from the role template) plus the toolset of every MCP server the profile enables. The grant is read at every tool call, so a toolset taken out of a pinned profile is refused at the next call, without a rebuilt session. At pin d76856cc Hermes builds a session's tools from `platform_toolsets` and does not apply that pin, and its MCP runtime ignores the `disabled` key `profiles.configure` writes, so without the gate a template's toolsets would describe the agent without limiting it. A profile without a pin is not narrowed, the `ergates` tools are never refused this way, and a grant that cannot be read blocks the call.

The gate refuses; it does not change the tool list a running session offers the model, so 04 section 5's rebuild still decides what the model sees. Rejected: writing `platform_toolsets` from the template, because `profiles.configure` has no such field and the app would need a config write outside the public RPCs.

## ADR-035 One egress proxy, one ingress, images pinned by digest

Decided 2026-09-25. In the Compose deployment the controllers and ntfy sit only on an internal network with no route out. An allowlisting Squid proxy is their one way to the internet (HTTPS tunnels to listed hosts only; IP addresses never match), and HAProxy is the one published door, forwarding the VPS's Tailscale IP ports to `hermes serve` and ntfy as plain TCP. The proxy variables tell well-behaved clients where the proxy is; the internal network is what enforces it (04 section 7). Every image is pinned by tag and digest, and `deploy/tests/test_static.py` checks these rules in CI.

Rejected: `HTTP_PROXY` on a normally networked container, which 04 section 7 says is not enforcement. Rejected: host firewall rules, which live outside Compose where the static checks cannot see them.
