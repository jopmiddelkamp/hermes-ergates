# Contributing to Ergates

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This is a small, single-maintainer project; keeping the process light keeps it sustainable.

## Branches

This repository uses the maintainer's `gflow` CLI and its gitflow model: `develop` is the integration branch, `master` only changes through releases and hotfixes, and every landing happens through a pull request with green CI.

- Work branches start from `develop`.
- Pull requests target `develop`, not `master`.
- If you don't use gflow yourself, that's fine: branch from `develop`, make your change, and open a pull request into `develop`.

## Setup, and running the checks

`scripts/ci-local.sh` runs the same jobs CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls this script for every job), so you can reproduce a CI failure locally.

```bash
scripts/ci-local.sh              # every job, in order
scripts/ci-local.sh mobile lint  # only these jobs
```

Tools needed, by job:

| Job | Command(s) | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `lint` | `bash -n` on the shell scripts, then `uvx --from shellcheck-py==0.11.0.1 shellcheck` on them, then `uvx --from actionlint-py==1.7.12.25 actionlint` on the workflow files | `bash`, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for `uvx`) |
| `mobile` | `npm ci` (fresh installs, or when `node_modules` is missing), then `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run depcruise` | Node 26, npm |
| `integration` | `uv run --python 3.11 --with pytest --with pytest-cov --with pyyaml pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=90` (run from `integrations/ergates`) | `uv`, Python 3.11 |
| `contract` | Prepares a pinned Hermes checkout (`HERMES_SOURCE`, or a local/fetched checkout at the pin), then `pytest contract` and `pytest contract/live` through the same `uv run` invocation as `integration` (run from `integrations/ergates`) | `uv`, Python 3.11, `git` |
| `deploy` | `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env.example config --quiet`, then `uv run --no-project --python 3.11 --with pytest --with pyyaml pytest -p no:cacheprovider deploy/tests` | Docker (with Compose), `uv`, Python 3.11 |

The quick loops from the README, for iterating on one part:

- `cd apps/mobile && npm test && npm run typecheck`
- `cd integrations/ergates && uv run --python 3.11 --with pytest --with pytest-cov --with pyyaml pytest`

## Tests

Behavior changes need tests. Both the mobile app (Vitest, `apps/mobile/vitest.config.mts`) and the integration package (`pytest --cov-fail-under=90`) enforce coverage gates in CI — a change that drops coverage below the gate fails the build.

## Commit messages

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary`, for example `fix(mobile): keep the outbox stall per connection` or `docs: plan the store release pipeline`. Check `git log` for the types and scopes already in use before picking your own.

## Code comments

Write comments and test titles in plain language that explains the *why*, not a planning, task, or code-review id — a reader has no upgrade plan or review ledger at hand, so a number like "Ruling 4" or "C3" tells them nothing. (ADR numbers, docs section numbers, Hermes `file:line` references, and upstream issue numbers are fine — they point at something a reader can open.)

This is enforced by a guard test on each side: `apps/mobile/test/plain-comments.test.ts` on the mobile app, and `integrations/ergates/tests/test_plain_docs.py` on the integration package.

## Releases

Releases are cut by the maintainer only, through gflow and the GitHub Actions release workflow. See [`apps/mobile/RELEASING.md`](apps/mobile/RELEASING.md) for how a release runs end to end.
